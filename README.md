# FusionDLS - Reduced model for divertor detachment analysis

This is DLS-Extended, a reduced 1D model based on the original DLS model (Lipschultz 2016, Cowley 2022, Myatra 2023).

To get started, please review the examples, which we also use as tests:

### Verification comparison against analytical DLS solution
https://github.com/FusionDLS/FusionDLS/blob/main/docs/examples/analytic_test.ipynb

### Basic use - analysis of individual front location solution and a front location scan
https://github.com/FusionDLS/FusionDLS/blob/main/docs/examples/basic_use.ipynb

### Manipulating the magnetic geometry to investigate divertor design
https://github.com/FusionDLS/FusionDLS/blob/main/docs/examples/geometry_manipulation.ipynb

### Reading GEQDSK files
https://github.com/FusionDLS/FusionDLS/blob/main/docs/examples/geqdsk.ipynb

## Docs
The examples are also on readthedocs (note: docs are WIP and may not contain all the examples):
